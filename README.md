About
-----

This is a simple implementation of Deferred Screen Space Directional Occlusion algorithm.

For more details, see http://kayru.org/articles/dssdo

Use [RenderMonkey](http://developer.amd.com/archive/gpu/rendermonkey/pages/default.aspx) to open the dssdo.rfx project.

Or just have a quick look through dssdo.hlsl for the "meat" of the algorithm.
